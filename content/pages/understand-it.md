Problem
==========

Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) data makes possible the continuous monitoring of water and energy fluxes at the earth surface.
In particular, algorithms to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from EOS data have been widely used. When the spatial resolution of
the images processed by these algorithms is even moderate — for instance, when they process those acquired by the Landsat family
of satellites that have a 30-meter resolution — the processing is computationally intensive and time-consuming, making it costly to
produce estimates at large scale — for wide areas, and long periods of time. Additionally, there is very little data sharing among
producers of ET data, which otherwise could increase the quantity of ET data collectively available to them.

What is SAPS?
==========

SAPS is a service to automate the workflow used to estimate ET from Landsat images, using cloud computing Infrastucture-as-a-Service (IaaS)
to enable shared and cost-effective access to the date by the community.
